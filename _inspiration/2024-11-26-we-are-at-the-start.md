> We are now at the start of the computer industry, an industry that will be the largest in the United States. The Model Tâ€™s of the computer industry are here, and people are beginning to use them. I am very much afraid we will make the same mistakes over again.

> We will buy beautiful pieces of hardware and software and totally neglect the underlying force, the total flow of information through any organization, activity, or company. 

> We should now be looking at the information flow, and then selecting the equipment that will best implement that flow. To do this, the very first thing we need to decide is which information is the most valuable and put our best equipment there.
